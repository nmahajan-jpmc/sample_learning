Welcome to the Quorum classrooms designed specifically keeping you in mind.
This playground is created just for you to get your hands dirty and learn quorum with minimal effort. It comes with a pre-installed quorum instance which is shared by you and your peers. 
As you move along you will compile and deploy a sample smart contract, use it to create simple dApps which will let you update and read a value from the blockchain. Once you are confident the field is all yours.
