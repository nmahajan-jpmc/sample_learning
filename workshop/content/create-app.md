You can create your own app. Just create a new folder using the 'mkdir' command. You can also initialize its contents using truffle. Just run
```execute
truffle init
```
Here is a small truffle cheat sheet for a quick reference
To compile a Smart Contract
```copy
echo "truffle compile"
```

To deploy a Smart Contract
```copy
echo "truffle migrate"
```

To execute a transaction or the dApp you have just written

```copy-and-edit
echo "truffle exec <app.js>"
```
